# FASTA Analyzer

This bioinformatics tool built with Python to analyze DNA sequences from FASTA files.  
It computes key sequence statistics such as GC content, codon usage, and open reading frames (ORFs), and provides visualizations for GC content distribution.

** Features
- Reads any `.fasta` file
- Calculates per-sequence and overall GC content
- Detects Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
- Computes codon usage frequency
- Generates GC content bar plot using `matplotlib`
- Provides sequence summary (count and total length)



** Usage
1. **Clone the repository**
